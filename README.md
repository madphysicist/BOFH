BOFH
====

Java implementation of the BOFH excuse generator. The excuses are customizable, but the originals are taken from http://bofh.ntk.net/BOFH/bastard-excuse-board.php. Do not send this program to Simon!

This program showcases some of the classes of the JTools project. In particular, it plays an audio clip when the wrong password is entered, and uses multiple CasinoSpinners.
